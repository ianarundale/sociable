For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, SociAbLe will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
